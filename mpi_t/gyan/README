Build Instructions
------------------
- Set MPI_INSTALL in Makefile to point to an MPI-T compliant MPI
  installation
- Run "make"


Usage Instructions
------------------

- Gyan can be used in one of two ways:
    - By dynamically loading the libgyan shared-library.
        $ LD_PRELOAD=$GYAN_INSTALL_PATH/libgyan.so srun -n 2 mpi_app
    - By statically linking the MPI application to libgyan.
        $ srun -n 2 mpi_app

- The sample MPI benchmarks in "tests" folder have been statically linked to
  libgyan, and can be used to test the installation. Run them as follows:
    $ srun -n 2 ./tests/osu_bcast
